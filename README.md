Goal
-
To incentivize media companies to film in Manhattan while generating economic value for property owners and reduces instances of crime.

Who would this benefit?
1) Film studios: Which areas of Manhattan are commonly portrayed in TV/Film? What are the risks of filming in these locations?
2) Property Owners: Will your your property value increase if more media is produced in your area?
3)Communities where films are made: Are crimes more common in areas that are filmed in more frequently?
