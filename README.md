Goal
-
To answer the question: How does the film industry impact the communities they film in?

Who would this benefit?
1) Film studios: Which areas of Manhattan are commonly portrayed in TV/Film? What are the risks of filming in these locations?

2) Property Owners: Will your your property value increase if more media is produced in your area?

3) Communities where films are made: Are crimes more common in areas that are filmed in more frequently?

This exploration could help to incentivize media companies to film in Manhattan while generating economic value for property owners while reducing instances of crime.
